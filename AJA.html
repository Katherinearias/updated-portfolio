                        <h5>Objective:</h5>
                        <p>Transform the Atlanta Jugglers Association website to provide more to users
                            who are not only looking to join the association, but also who are interested in learning
                            how to juggle, hiring their services, or donating to their cause.

                        <br>
                        <h5>Solution</h5>
                        <p>The navigation on the current site is cluttered and a bit confusing, as to what’s most
                            important for our users to know. We simplified it by creating a primary navigation bar
                            that would be most useful for users to find key features, such as how to be a part of
                            the organization, events, about us, and how to contact. </p>

                        <h5>Summary</h5>
                        <p class="small-margin-bottom"> The Atlanta Jugglers Association was in need of a website
                            redesign. As we tested the initial website, many things that could be upgraded were pointed
                            out. We reached out to the organization but unfortunately could not interview anyone there.
                            We set out to make the page look more professional, but keep it fun. Our goal was to
                            transform the Atlanta Jugglers Association website to provide more to users who are not only
                            looking to join the association, but also who are interested in learning how to juggle,
                            hiring their services, or donating to their cause.
                            We felt it was valuable to help this non-profit because the Atlanta Jugglers Association
                            does more than put on a performance. They are active members within the community aspiring
                            to bring joy and happiness to those around them - anywhere from local parades to children’s
                            hospital events.

                            I was heavily involved in the research phase of this project. I recommended my team and I
                            test the original website with potential users to get some better insight. I also reached
                            out to the organization, but unfortunately could not test our product with their members. I
                            also added the assets to
                            the high fidelity mobile prototype by following our style guide.

                                    activity. My team and I first card sorted within our group and recorded our results.
                                    We then did a card sorting session with 3 other people who gave us different insight
                                    on what users would like to see on each page outside of what we though belonged in
                                    each category, It was refreshing to have outside perspective on the website
                                    navigation. We used the card sorting data to create a <span class="highlight">sitemap</span>.

                                    received important feedback before moving on to our high fidelity prototype. .

                                    changed how our team communicated and collaborated on designs. We went from meeting
                                    3 times a week in person to constantly communicating through Slack and meeting 3
                                    times a week on Zoom. Although it took some adjusting, we were able to distribute the
                                    work responsibilities in order to complete the beautiful redesign that we were proud
                                    to present to our class. *
