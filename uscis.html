                        <p class="small-margin-bottom">
                            The task I was given was to redesign a government website. I chose the USCIS website because
                            I have personally used it and have met others who have had to navigate through it. My
                            testing supported the initial feeling I had when I first encountered the website many years
                            ago. It is intimidating, cold, and overwhelming. I set out to make the redesign clean,
                            direct and modern. My goal was to make it inviting and not intimidating, especially when the
                            process of seeking U.S citizenship can be scary enough for some. I applied user research by
                            conducting interviews, heuristic evaluations and applying information architecture. I then
                            created a prototype for users to test after testing the original website. While my prototype
                            still had some faults, many users found it easier to navigate through.

                        <h5>My Contribution</h5>
                        <p class="small-margin-bottom">
                            I conducted about 3 interviews for the qualitative data. I also completed our competitor
                            analysis and picked which points to highlight that would benefit us in our design. Everyone
                            on my team created sketches for the UI design. I then contributed to the basic colors we
                            would use in our interface and the design of our onboarding. I, along with my teammates,
                            conducted usability testing on our app and then pin pointed which parts in our design we
                            could iterate on.

                            <span class="bold">1.</span> I began by creating a <span class="highlight">proto-persona</span> based on the kind of people
                            that I knew had used the website before, which was a <span class="highlight">foreigners seeking help with
                            naturalization</span> (the process of becoming a U.S. citizen)
                            <br><br>
                            <span class="bold">2.</span> I then created a <span class="highlight">testing plan</span> with the assumption that users
                            know what they are looking for since they would be visiting the website with a purpose. I
                            conducted a <span class="highlight">heuristic evaluation</span> to measure the usability and pin point any issues.
                            <br><br>
                            <span class="bold">3.</span> I then asked friends and family to test out the website and
                            point out any issues they had with it. A lot of people had similar points which included<span class="highlight">
                            repeated links, overwhelming groups of text, and not being able to properly find what they
                            were looking for (or not knowing when they had found it).</span>
                            <br><br>
                            <span class="bold">4.</span> I then asked another group of people to help me <span class="highlight">card sort
                            categories and content on the website.</span> After evaluating all the data collected I created a
                            site map. I also went on to create a <span class="highlight">style guide</span> based on the colors already being used on
                            the USCIS website to stay on brand.
                            <br><br>
                            <span class="bold">5.</span> After creating the <span class="highlight">site map</span> and style guide I drafted the <span class="highlight">low fidelity
                            wireframes</span> for my redesign. Once I tested that wireframe on two users I iterated on it and
                            added UI elements following my style guide. Finally I tested my <span class="highlight">high fidelity prototype</span> and
                            gathered feedback from the results. Overall, I wish I could have tested more people that fit
                            my target user but I believe the feedback I received was extremely valuable.
